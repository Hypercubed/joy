backup of the joy programming language

* note that
  the code base is not clean in my view
  I do not maintain this implementation
  I just learn from the design of the language

* if you care about the life of joy language
  and you consider the code base hackable
  do a fork and maintain it

to build the interpreter of joy
just type make
